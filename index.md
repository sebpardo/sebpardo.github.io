I am currently an Aquatic Biologist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada, working in the Ecosystem Science Division under Jackie King, where I'm modelling Pacific salmon spatiotemporal trends and chum life cycles.

Previously, I was the Sustainable Fisheries Coordinator at the [Ecology Action Centre](https://ecologyaction.ca), a member-based environmental charity in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In this role, I advocate for resilient fisheries in Atlantic Canada that are socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable. 
I've also worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Dalhousie University in Halifax, where I explored life-history patterns among wild Atlantic salmon populations in Eastern Canada with the late Jeff Hutchings. <!-- https://www.fishlifehistory.ca/ -->
I completed my [PhD](https://summit.sfu.ca/item/17259) in 2017 with [Nick Dulvy](https://www.dulvy.com) at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, where my research focused on understanding the relationships among life histories in sharks, rays, and chimaeras. 
For my undergraduate Honours research at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, I explored dietary partitioning among co-occurring coastal stingrays working with [Mike Bennett](https://biomedical-sciences.uq.edu.au/profile/738/mike-bennett).
