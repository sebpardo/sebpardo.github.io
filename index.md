I am interested in understanding the mechanisms that underpin relationships among life histories in fishes, and using these relationships to develop simple methods for predicting the biological traits and extinction risk of data-poor species.

I have recently finished my PhD working with [Nick Dulvy](http://www.dulvy.com) at Simon Fraser University in Canada, where my research focused on understanding the relationships among life histories in sharks, rays, and chimaeras.
