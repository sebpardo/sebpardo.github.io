I am a graduate student at Simon Fraser University working with [Nick Dulvy](http://www.dulvy.com) on shark and ray life histories and developing tools for predicting the biology and vulnerability of data poor sharks and rays.

### Research interests:

I am interested in exploring relationships among shark and ray life histories, how they vary, and what traits can explain their variation. Better understanding these relationships gives us a glimpse into the potential evolutionary mechanisms that have shaped them.

I am also passionate about conservation, and am keen to improve our current knowledge gap within elasmobranchs, as 46% of the are assessed as Data Deficient under the IUCN. In many cases, the usual methods of studying the biology of a species using lethal sampling are not feasible, such as species that are extremely rare, hard to collect, or listed as Critically Endangered.

I have focused my research on developing simple methods for predicting biological traits and extinction risk that rely on readily-available data, and are based on the life history relationships found among well-studied species.
