I am a graduate student at Simon Fraser University working with [Nick Dulvy](http://www.dulvy.com) on life history theory as a tool for predicting the biology and vulnerability of data poor sharks and rays.

### Research interests:

I am interested in understanding the relationships among life histories as a way to better understand the evolutionary processes that shape them. 


I am also passionate about conservation, and am keen to improve our current knowledge gap within elasmobranchs, as 46% of the are assessed as Data Deficient under the IUCN. In many cases, the usual methods of studying the biology of a species using lethal sampling are not feasible, such as species that are extremely rare, hard to collect, or listed as Critically Endangered.

These interests have motivated me to focus my research on developing simple methods for predicting biological traits and extinction risk that rely on readily-available data, and are based on the life history relationships found among well-studied species.
