Because this split was made in a BirdLife publication, the justification is repeated here in full (but the references are not supplied). Both Hachisuka (1931-1935) and Voous (1947) treated ramsayi as a separate species, and indeed it is so distinctive as to be arguably closer to Sulawesi Woodpecker P. temminckii than it is to P. maculatus (this view is also expressed, with the comment that ramsayi is ""the ancestor common to both"", by White and Bruce 1986), and given the evident morphological proximity of Brown-capped P. moluccensis, Grey-capped P. canicapillus and Pygmy Woodpeckers P. kizuki to both maculatus (non-Sulu forms) and ramsayi, there is no compelling reason to combine the latter two as a single species. Sulu birds differ from other Philippine forms in: replacing all black or dark brown with a mid-brown; lacking virtually all white spotting on wings and coverts; lacking black or dark brown spotting or streaking on the undersides; showing an ill-defined yellow or yellowish-orange breast-band, plus (in the male) a far more strongly developed red area on the nape. The specific separation of ramsayi is all the more arguable for the geographically closest representative of maculatus - fulvifasciatus of Mindanao and Basilan showing the strongest pied effect. The notion that these two forms are ""bridged"" by maculatus, with a throw-away description of ramsayi as ""aberrant"" (Salomonsen 1953), not only fails to deal with the suggestion of Voous (1947) that ramsayi represents an early invasion of the Philippines, but also misses the point that maculatus is not geographically interposed between the two forms it is supposed to bridge. It is worth noting that in the paper in which both ramsayi and fulvifasciatus were first established, the formal description of ramsayi compared it to temminckii rather than to maculatus (Hargitt 1881).",del Hoyo and Collar (2014),22681046,626

However, genetic and morphological analysis since published by Fjelds&aring; et al. (2013) presented strong evidence that the specimens referred to as H. perdita are in fact fledglings of O. madagascariensis in a poorly known dull and nondescript brown plumage: genetic sequencing found a divergence of just 0.1% between the two specimens of H. perdita and Oxylabes madagascariensis, and there were also strong morphological similarities between the specimens and Oxylabes.

(1998), but this was not followed by Fishpool and Tobias (2005), since the phylogenetic analyses are open to alternative interpretations, such that other, possibly all, subspecies within the nigriceps group merit elevation to species level. Vocal differences between at least some of these races are however small. Pending further study, the BirdLife Taxonomic Working Group considers it preferable to treat the form chlorigula (split by Sibley and Monroe from rest of nigriceps and subsequently recognised by BirdLife) as a subspecies of nigriceps, along with fusciceps.","Sibley & Monroe (1990, 1993)",22712815,7226

However, they did not analyse DNA from oldeani or deckeni, which form a bridge in characters to or from roehli, with deckeni forming a clear geographical and morphological stepping stone from roehli north to abyssinicus, nor do they discuss them in any way in relation to the proposed establishment of roehli as a species. Moreover, the morphological distinctiveness of roehli, particularly in relation to deckeni, is not very strong. The BirdLife Taxonomic Working Group does not therefore accept it as a species and considers that it appears perfectly in place as the end of a cline of characters from abyssinicus through deckeni.",Bowie et al.

PASSERIFORMES,Fringillidae,Finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers,Scottish Crossbill,Loxia scotica,"Hartert, 1904",R,LC,,,"Loxia crossbills are conifer seed specialists for which there is an increasing body of evidence to show that bill morphology and overall body size, the main morphological features by which forms vary, are intimately linked to the cone structure and size of the particular conifer species (or mosaics of species) upon which they feed. There is also increasing evidence that different populations of crossbills show differences in flight and excitement calls which co-vary with bill shape, and hence with the distributions of their main food sources (e.g. Borras et al. 2008, Edelaar 2008a, 2008b). This evidence is especially well developed in the case of the Scottish Crossbill Loxia scotica by Summers et al. (2002, 2007) to support treatment of L. scotica as a species distinct from both Common Crossbill L. curvirostra and Parrot Crossbill L. pytyopsittacus. In particular, Summers et al. (2007) present data to show that, in areas of broad sympatry in Scotland, these forms largely breed assortatively. Although they do show some degree of hybridisation, in the view of Summers et al. (2007) this is insufficient not to warrant recognition as species, despite overlaps in morphology and the lack of any genetic differentiation. , Some uncertainty remains regarding the status of this form, and an alternative approach is to regard different vocal types as components of a single resource-polymorphic species. Assortative mating by voice-type could prove to be a consequence of post-pairing vocal copying. More generally, increasing numbers of vocal types are being discovered among sympatric populations of crossbills whenever sufficiently detailed studies are carried out. The American Ornithologists'' Union (BirdLife''s taxonomic source for North America) has yet to recognise any of the nine North American ''vocal types'' as species, although the case for the first of these was made over twenty years ago (Groth 1988). , Nevertheless, given the evidence currently available and associated uncertainties, BirdLife continues to follow the Association of European Rarities Committees in treating L. scotica as a species distinct from L. curvirostra and L. pytyopsittacus.","AERC TAC (2003); Cramp et al.
