Climate justice is tied to systems of inequality.
Many authors, activists, and scholars have pointed out the inseparable relationship between
climate change and the free market forces aiming to maximise profits at the expense of pretty much
anything and anyone. 
Pretty much everyone living under this predominantly western framework is dependent
on the current socioeconomic structure to meet their basic needs: food, water, and shelter.
Within this society, there is a growing group of concerned people who are aware of the unsustainable
nature of the current poli-socioeconomic model and its inexorable concomitants such as colonialism, oppression,
and environmental destruction. While it is hard to compare these issues in terms of importance, 
it is difficult to deny how paramount dealing with climate change is for our survival.

One of Harsha Walia's premises for a successful anti-imperialistic movement is to make sure your actions are
not negatively impacting other anti-colonial/anti-imperialist struggles. Given the global scope of the problem,
it is impossible to fully grasp how our lives are impacting others around the globe. 
How is our lifestyle is negatively impacting the anti-imperialistic struggle of 
other people, particularly in the global south?

It is becoming apparent to many that our western lifestyles are built on global resource extraction, which is accompanied
with oppression and dispossession of people in the global south. 
Even the 19th century poet Isabella Valancy Crawford made reference
to Canada being built on the back of dead aboriginals, who made the bulk of the exploited people
in that time. 
However, among left-leaning politically-minded individuals, there is a dichotomy between our goal of living sustainably 
and our western lifestyle. Whereas the individual can strive to act in such a way as to not
be a part of any systems of oppression, the global impact resulting from him/her being a part of 
the system likely outweigh the benefit of the attempted changes from within.
In an attempt to address injustice, many of us in the western world change our lifestyle: 
we recycle, reduce our car use, we buy local and avoid overconsumption, just to name a few.
But what if this isn't enough? What if what it takes is such a major change of lifestyle that
very few people are likely to make this sacrifice before we hit a point of no return.
What if our very existence is providing the capital for the cogs of capitalism to keep turning?
In other words, the issue is our dependence in our current resource intensive, capital driven society.

It is increasingly difficult to become aware of the degree to which our lifestyle is dependent on the global
economic framework, and the impacts our day to day has on a global scale. A recent investigation by the Associated Press 
linking the enslavement of hundreds of Burmese men with distributors who in turn sell seafood to North American
retail stores is a jarring and straightforward example of this [@McDowell2015]. 
Cognitive mapping can help to raise the interconnectedness of these issues, to some degree at least.

People with a social conscience feel a responsibility to act. They act such as to feel they are making a difference.
Regardless of our actions within the system, we might still be turning the cogs of the machine we are trying to stop. 

In his book "Juggernaut"[@Morse2010], economist Neil Morse posits that one of the key ways of not contributing
to the current economic system is to have the ability or option to step out from it,
and suggested the need of having self-sufficient structures that can maintain us in order to
withdraw (or have the option to withdraw) when needed or wanted.
Applying these changes in our lifestyle requires, among other things, to make radical changes 
in our way of living, many of which are very large sacrifices that most of us are not willing
to make. As Daniel Quinn's Ishmael[@Quinn2009] puts it, as a society we need to stop being Takers and
go back to being Leavers.

Ranging from changing our pervasive educational systems, driving individuality and competition over community and collaboration,
to switching the means of food production from fuel intensive large scale practices to
labour intensive and local ones, 
to significantly reducing our material wants and limiting our recreation options; the latter a trend
which judging by increasing wealth inequality in almost any country you look at, is going in the opposite direction.
The changes in lifestyle required are so broad and vast that it could be said our western existence in itself
is the problem.

Even if we are in a position to make this changes, many others are not. 
There are victims of the system who need to be a part of it to survive, such as 
the people living in extreme poverty, or those trapped by debt.
This only confounds the problem.
The admirable efforts of those dedicating their lives to proving the necessary tools
to those most affected by oppression are a bitter-sweet reminder of how difficult of a task
we have in front of us.

**So what the hell do we do?**

- We need to think beyond our borders and realise how life in the global north is supported
by oppression of the global south.
- We need to stop participating in the global economies that drive environmental destruction 
and be able to live sustainably without depending on a globalised economy to support us.
- We need to end our reliance in the global means of production and strengthen
local communities in the process.
- We need to make sure our anti-oppressive lifestyles are not driving oppression and 
dispossession in any region of our planet.
- We need to be willing to make large sacrifices, that might not even be successful, so that
future generations everywhere in this planet have a shot at being born in a better world.

What we need, is to truly take the capital out of capitalism. And that capital is ourselves.
